          Outside of my studies, I enjoy going to the gym, where I focus on
          building my physical fitness and improving my overall well-being. I
          believe that maintaining a healthy lifestyle is essential for both
          physical and mental health, and I find that regular exercise helps me
          stay focused and energized. Additionally, I make it a priority to work
          on my mental health through mindfulness practices and self-reflection.
          In my downtime, I love watching movies across various genres. Whether
          it’s a thought-provoking drama or an action-packed adventure, I
          appreciate how films can tell compelling stories and inspire
          creativity. I also enjoy listening to music, which serves as a source
          of inspiration and relaxation for me. Music has the power to elevate
          my mood and help me unwind after a long day. These activities not only
          help me relax but also encourage personal growth and a balanced
          lifestyle.
